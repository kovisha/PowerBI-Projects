It was important for us to get away from the crowds where reasonably possible and see the Sri Lanka which has not been tainted by mass-tourism.

The obvious way, as we had discovered in a couple of other countries, was to find a local tour company with a track record we could trust.

More research quickly led to Red Dot Tours and  the fast response from Ms Dulmini, one of their advisers, to our initial enquiry immediately started pressing the the right buttons.

They listened to what we wanted and came back with a proposed tour, right sort of accommodation and travel arrangements and were even able to get us an attractive flight ticket deal, through their UK office. A final version of the itinerary was quickly agreed, accommodation confirmed and arrangements completed. All within a remarkably short time.

The holiday went perfectly and everything was so professionally organised.  It’s obvious Red Dot has earned considerable respect from the Sri Lankan hospitality industry.

I think their choice of chauffeur/guide was a crucial part of our enjoyment of the holiday as a whole: he is Mr Dami and he deserves special mention.  His sense of humour, commentary on things and places as well as his awesome knowledge of birds, animals, trees, plants. National and local history was an inspiration.  We are grateful to Red Dot for choosing him to look after us and would strongly recommend him to future travellers to Sri Lanka.

So many things stand out, including a trip by tuk tuk and boat to small village way off the beaten track, to buy ingredients for lunch and then learn how best to cook them (and enjoy the end product), getting involved with a couple of others  from the turtle conservation organisation, to safely launch newly hatched baby turtles,, getting to see very large, wild water monitors up close, making stops for (excellent) morning coffee in the most unexpected, beautiful places, and so on……

Favourite hotel….  has to be KK Beach near Galle.
Room, view, location, food and, above all, a really brilliant crew !      Thanks, Red Dot.",63ff3dd0e4b0d53f17f0cdab,4,PUBLISHED,PUBLISHED

6 hotels and over 1000 kms where the low tourist numbers meant we had exclusive use of a couple of hotels, and where the buffet style arrangements were (for now) cooked to order and less wasteful. This worked well and there was still plenty of choice with attentive staff who genuinely thanked us for visiting Sri Lanka.
We saw fuel queues, long ones, but this never impacted on our plans, I assume our driver was out every night dealing with this behind the scenes, while he planned surprise visits and ideas for the next day's journey. He added immensely to our holiday and his bird knowledge and enthusiasm was contagious, even our granddaughter began to know the bird names. The exchange rate was good and our money lasted well.

We were overwhelmed by the thought of planning such an important day in a foreign country while in the midst of a global pandemic. This is where Red Dot came in and made it such a smooth experience for us. We were dealing with Dinu who we cannot thank enough. She helped us secure our visas, advised on legal paper works required for the wedding, put us in contact with our amazing wedding planner (Thilini from Resplendent Ceylon), arranged all covid requirements and of course put together our tour itinerary! I mean it when I say there was literally nothing we had to do other than show up and enjoy the holiday. Like all tourists we had to do some PCR tests during our stay. In each case the medical team came to our hotel to perform the test resulting in zero disruption to our holiday. We stayed in a total of 6 hotels while in Sri Lanka and ALL were amazing! The quality of food and service were exceptional. We didn’t think it would be possible to visit tourist destinations given the restrictions but were delighted to hear we could and we managed visits to Yala national Park, Ceylon tea trails, the temple of the tooth, Sigiriya fortress and Polonnaruwa. We smoothly transitioned between each destination with the help of our tour guide Indika. He was amazing and we would recommend requesting him for your tour. He is highly knowledgeable, passionate about Sri Lanka and most importantly a safe driver! You can tell from the reception he received at each of the hotels that he is well respected by the staff. When it came to the wedding day itself we again must thank Dinu who helped organize the day on such short notice. She presented us with options and acted quickly to ensure enough notice was given to make sure our celebration was legal. We decided to choose Cape Weligama by Resplendent Ceylon for the special day and we couldn’t have been happier with how they looked after us during our stay and on the day itself. It is the most breathtaking destination. Our experience with Red Dot was simply amazing. A piece of our heart is in Sri Lanka now and we will be back and we will be using Dinu, Indika and team again.

All our hotels were exactly as we expected, in fact some even exceeded our expectations.
We were unfortunate to be in Colombo on the Easter Sunday bombings. Again our driver together with Red Dot looked after us so well. They advised us to leave the Galle Face Hotel and instantly found us a safe little homestay with swimming pool to keep the kids entertained. Sarisa kept us up to date with the situation and took us the airport. I'm sure a place he would have rather avoided from a personal position.

We were unfortunate to be in Colombo on the Easter Sunday bombings. Again our driver together with Red Dot looked after us so well.
